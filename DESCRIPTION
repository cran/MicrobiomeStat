Description: A suite of methods for powerful and robust microbiome data analysis addressing zero-inflation, phylogenetic structure and compositional effects (Zhou et al. (2021)<arXiv:2104.00242>).  The methods can be applied to the analysis of other (high-dimensional) compositional data arising from sequencing experiments.
